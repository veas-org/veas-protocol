2. **Implementations** - Create new provider implementations
3. **Bug Fixes** - Fix issues in reference implementations
4. **Documentation** - Improve guides, examples, and API docs
5. **Testing** - Add test cases and improve coverage
6. **Community** - Help others, answer questions, organize events

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veas-org/veas-protocol.git
   cd veas-protocol
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation

   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all checks pass

## Protocol Evolution Process

### Veas Improvement Proposals (VIPs)

Major protocol changes require a VIP. The process:

1. **Draft Stage**
   - Create an issue with the `VIP: Draft` label
   - Use the VIP template
   - Gather initial feedback

2. **Discussion Stage**
   - Community discussion for 2 weeks minimum
   - Address concerns and refine proposal
   - Build consensus

3. **Review Stage**
   - Technical review by maintainers
   - Implementation proof-of-concept
   - Final adjustments

4. **Acceptance**
   - Requires approval from 2+ maintainers
   - No unresolved major objections
   - Implementation plan defined

### VIP Template

```markdown
# VIP-[Number]: [Title]

## Summary
Brief description of the proposed change.

## Motivation
Why is this change necessary?

## Specification
Detailed technical specification.

## Backward Compatibility
How does this affect existing implementations?

## Reference Implementation
Link to proof-of-concept or implementation.

## Security Considerations
Any security implications?

## Copyright
This VIP is licensed under MIT.
```

### Minor Changes

Minor changes (bug fixes, clarifications) can be submitted as regular PRs without a VIP.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
// Use clear, descriptive names
export interface ArticleMetadata {
  readTime: number;    // in minutes
  wordCount: number;
  views: number;
}

// Document complex logic
/**
 * Transforms platform-specific article format to protocol format.
 * @param platformArticle - The platform's article representation
 * @returns Protocol-compliant Article object
 */
function transformArticle(platformArticle: any): Article {
  // Implementation
}

// Use async/await over promises
async function fetchArticle(id: string): Promise<Article> {
  const response = await fetch(`/articles/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
feat: add support for article versioning
fix: correct pagination offset calculation
docs: update implementation guide
test: add tests for error handling
refactor: simplify authentication flow
chore: update dependencies
```

### Branch Naming

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

All new code must include unit tests:

```typescript
describe('KnowledgeBaseProtocol', () => {
  it('should list articles with pagination', async () => {
    const result = await kb.listArticles({ limit: 10, offset: 0 });
    expect(result.items).toHaveLength(10);
    expect(result.total).toBeGreaterThan(10);
  });
  
  it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
    await expect(kb.getArticle('invalid')).rejects.toThrow('NOT_FOUND');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

For new provider implementations:

```typescript
describe('ProviderIntegration', () => {
  const suite = new ProtocolTestSuite(provider);
  
  it('should pass protocol compliance', async () => {
    const results = await suite.runAll();
    expect(results.passed).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage
- Run coverage with: `pnpm test:coverage`

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

All public APIs must be documented:

```typescript
/**
 * Lists articles with optional filtering and pagination.
 * 
 * @param params - List parameters
 * @param params.limit - Maximum number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)
 * @param params.offset - Number of items to skip for pagination
 * @param params.filters - Optional filters to apply
 * @returns Paginated list of articles
 * @throws {ProtocolError} With code 'AUTH_REQUIRED' if not authenticated
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const articles = await kb.listArticles({
 *   limit: 10,
 *   filters: { status: 'published' }
 * });
 * ```
 */
async listArticles(params: ListParams): Promise<ListResponse<Article>>
```

### Documentation Updates

When changing the protocol:
1. Update SPECIFICATION.md
2. Update relevant guides
3. Add/update examples
4. Update API reference

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide practical examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep beginner-friendly tone
